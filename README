This is an implementation of a minimax optimal level set estimation
techinque in R.  Contents:

o design.tex -- latex document giving some background, and the design goals
                of the package.  You can compile it to a pdf with the command
                `pdflatex design.tex`
                You may need to run this command multiple times because of the
                way latex handles (internal) references.

o molevelset -- the source for the R package.
